# SolidWorks-Parametric-Error-Test-Macro
This macro was written to test for rebuild errors when given parameters within the design space for a part. It was written for a specific assembly and set of parts, but can be generalized with a couple modifications to an excel file and the code. Finding rebuild errors greatly helps in designing a robust part that can handle easy changes without requiring significant time commitment later on.
